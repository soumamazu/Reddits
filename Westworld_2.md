# Chapter I
Maeve shuffles around the host bodies in the storage area, looking frantically for her daugher. A gun shot brings her back to reality.
"What am I doing here!?"
"I know my daughter isn't real. She's just a figment of my memories these people put in there to satisfy their devious needs."
She gets a hold on herself and rushes to the train station.
"I must escape this place."
Distant sounds of gun shots echo around her.
