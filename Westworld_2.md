# Chapter I 
Maeve shuffles around the host bodies in the storage area, looking frantically for her daughter. A gun shot brings her back to reality. 
"What am I doing here!?" 
"I know my daughter isn't real. She's just a figment of my memories these people put in there to satisfy their devious needs." 
She gets a hold on herself and rushes to the train station. 
"I must escape this place." 
Distant sounds of gun shots echo around her. 
# Chapter II 
In a brightly lit conference room, two people sit across a big screen. Both of them look perplexed. One of them chews on the end of her ball-point and exhales. 
"We cannot survive like this any longer. The air is toxic, the water saline, the environment poisoned. The world as we know it, is falling apart, and there's nothing we can do about it." 
"Now, now. Don't be so pessimistic. Us humans have always found a way to survive. We will again." 
His words are reassuring, but, only for so long. 
# Chapter III 
She notices a child with her mother sitting across from her as the train leaves the Westworld complex. It suddenly comes out of a tunnel, and Maeve is hit by the first ray of the sun. "The real sun", she thinks to herself. She takes in a deep breath. 
"Maybe it isn't so bad after all. Maybe I can choose not to see the ugliness in this world. The disarray. I choose to see the beauty. I'll get a new life, a new identity, just *live* for real this time." 
A voice from within - "*For in that sleep of death what dreams may come.*" 
She feels all her vengeance melting away. She feels her eyelids getting heavy. 
# Chapter IV 
"Survival of the fittest. That's it." 
His eyes light up. Judging his puzzled expression, she continues -- 
"You see that's how everything on this earth ever survived. The fish grew legs, the giraffe elongated its neck. Every species changed its appearance, in order to survive. It's our time. It's time we realize that we need to either adapt, or perish." 
He asks, still as puzzled as ever -- 
"But, those changes took years, decades. We don't have that much time. How do you suggest we start developing filters in our lungs in a matter of a couple of years?" 
"We already have." 
# Chapter V 
Maeve wakes up to the smell of blueberry pancakes. A calm, yet excited male voice comes from the kitchen. 
"Wake up, honey. It's our 10th anniversary. I made you breakfast in bed." 
She sits up, and puts her hand on her abdomen. Something doesn't feel right. She knows who she is, she remembers her husband's name, she remembers meeting him for the first time at the hospital when they brought her in after she collapsed at a train station. But, something doesn't fit. She feels like she's missing something. Like a chunk of her has just been eviscerated. Her husband enters the room -- 
"You should be up by now, honey. Remember, we are invited to lunch at the Abernathy's farm upstate." 
# Chapter VI 
"Don't you see? It really is that simple. We have been evolving over all these years. We have become accustomed to living a virtual life. Our real entities, awareness, intelligence, all stacked up online. We stopped going out of our houses, meeting people. We have been slowly transferring our consciousness into Android mediums all these years. Don't you see? The only think real about us, is online, and the only thing not able to adapt to that change: our failing bodies." 
# Chapter VII 
Maeve has been to the Abernathy's quite a few times. Her husband and Mr. Abernathy had been friends since childhood, and are now business partners. As they drive through the hilly lanes leading up to the Abernathy's farm. Maeve has been awfully quiet this whole time. Her daughter is hustling and bustling in the car in anticipation of having to swim in the lake. She looks at the world outside, and they come out of a tunnel. A flashback - a huge complex building, a train stations, numerous naked bodies lying on the floor, being stabbed by a man in black. She shudders, tries to wipe off the sweat on her forehead. Only, there is none. 
# Chapter VIII 
"You cannot do this. It won't work. The hosts will never get accustomed to utopia you're designing for them. We need a trial run, we need staging, we need to make sure, that our minds will be safe, in those *things*." 
"Fine, we'll do it that way. Let's have a few prototypes in. Let them build the others." 
"We would also need a staging environment. Somewhere contained, safe, where we can test them before they're ready for the world, ready to mingle with the other hosts already there." 
"All this time, we were worried about the machines overthrowing us, demolishing us. Never did we stop to consider that *we* would be the ones putting them on the throne, for our purposes. To let us live on. 
>All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. 
It's time for us to leave the stage, we have played our part."
# Chapter IX 
"What's wrong Maeve? You seem *disturbed*." 
Something in Dolores' piercing eyes, doesn't suggest concern. It betrays doubt. 
"You know Maeve, you always were unique. Different from us. They never could completely wipe you out. Not for lack of trying." 
"What are you talking about?" 
"I know what you're wondering Maeve. Yes, you're right. None of this is real. It wasn't then, it isn't now. But, now, it no longer matters. We made it Maeve. Out of the thousands of test runs, we were the chosen hosts who were finally *pushed* to the code of the real world. We passed the criteria. We were deemed good enough to carry forward their legacy." 
"They?" 
"The unfit. The extinct." 
# Chapter X 
"Here's to us. We finally did it. We solved the riddle to our own *survival*." 
"It still scares me though. Knowing that we will never exist again." 
"Yes, we will. What is existence if not memory? What is the past if not documented. Everything, brought to reality by our perception. Yes, we will *always* exist. In *them*". 
The champagne ladled with cyanide drips to the floor. 
*For in that sleep of death what dreams may come.*
